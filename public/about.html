<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! thanks for visiting my page. My name is Jess and I am an aspiring web developer. I began my coding journey at the
  age of 13 on tumblr.com. As many young people at the time did, I opened the html panal with a mixture of awe and petrification.
  Soon though, I was wading through html code like a pro to make the best tumblr homepage I could.
</p>

<p>Since then I have embarked on many adventures. I've worked selling shoes, serving fish and chips, hunting down people to do
  the cencus, tutoring, and most recently teaching. As a jack of all trades and master of none, I hope that coding can be the one (nice little rhyming there).
</p>

<p>Stay a while and have a look around. If you are interested in the projects I have shown here and want to contect me with an amazing job opportunity,
  you can do so by going to the home page and clicking on the 'contact me' button. 
</p>

<p>Bye for now!</p> <br />
